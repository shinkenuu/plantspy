"Carie, who needs water the most right now?","Eddie and Tilla's soil humidity are low","We need to check for not good soil humidity in all plants","list_plants[ ]","Eddie has low air humidity, low air temperature, low soil humidity, low soil ph, low light level\nIduna has good air humidity, good air temperature, good soil humidity, good soil ph, good light level\nViolet high air humidity, high air temperature, high soil humidity, high soil ph, high light level\nTilla good air humidity, low air temperature, low soil humidity, high soil ph, good light level","We know Eddie and Tilla have low soil humidity","Finish[Eddie and Tilla's soil humidity are low]"
"Did I watered Iduna today?","Iduna has a good soil humidity at the moment","We need to read Iduna's soil humidity sensor in order to know its current, minimum, maximum and ideal values","read_plant_sensor[Iduna, soil_humidity]","Iduna's soil humidity currently is 70.0. Ideally it should be between 60.0 and 80.0","We know Iduna's current and ideal soil humidity","Finish[Iduna has good soil humidity]"
"Is Violet over-watered?","Yes, Violet's soil humidity too high","We need to read Violet's soil humidity sensor in order to know its current, minimum, maximum and ideal values","read_plant_sensor[Violet, soil_humidity]","Violet's soil humidity currently is 93.5. Ideally it should be between 70.0 and 90.0","We know Violet's current and ideal soil humidity","Finish[Yes, Violet's soil humidity too high]"
