What is the ideal air humidity for Tilla?,Tilla's air humidity ideally is between 50.0 and 70.0,"We need to read Tilla's air humidity sensor in order to know its minimum, maximum and ideal values","read_plant_sensor[Tilla, air_humidity]",Tilla's air humidity currently is 62.6. Ideally it should be between 50.0 and 70.0,"We know Tilla's ideal air humidity range",Finish[Tilla's air humidity ideally is between 50.0 and 70.0]
Is the air too damp for Violet?,"Yes, Violet's air humidity currently is too high at 91.1","We need to read Violet's air humidity sensor in order to know its current, minimum, maximum and ideal values","read_plant_sensor[Violet, air_humidity]",Violet's air humidity currently is 91.1. Ideally it should be between 60.0 and 80.0,We know the air humidity for Violet is above maximum ideal,"Finish[Yes, Violet's air humidity currently is too high at 91.1]"
"The air is a little dry today, is it not?","Not really, only Eddie has a low air humidity currently measured at 28.7",We need to check for low air humidity in all plants,list_plants[ ],"Eddie has low air humidity, low air temperature, low soil humidity, low soil ph, low light level\nIduna has good air humidity, good air temperature, good soil humidity, good soil ph, good light level\nViolet high air humidity, high air temperature, high soil humidity, high soil ph, high light level\nTilla good air humidity, low air temperature, low soil humidity, high soil ph, good light level",We know Eddie has low air humidity,"read_plant_sensor[Eddie, air_humidity]",Eddie's air humidity currently is 28.7. Ideally it should be between 30.0 and 50.0,We know only Eddie has low air humidity,"Finish[Not really, only Eddie has a low air humidity currently measured at 28.7]"
